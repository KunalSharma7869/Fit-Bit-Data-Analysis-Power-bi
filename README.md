# Introduction
Analyse the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data to gain insights into how consumers and users are using the Fitbit App and discover trends using Python to visualize it using SAP Analytics Cloud. Smartwatches have taken over the world and are essentially making the lives much easier by connecting all the useful apps and tracking our data to provide useful information to the users. FitBit is one such smart watch that enables the users to track their steps taken, calories burned, total minutes of sleep, active hours of the day and much more.

5. weight_log: It consists of BMI of the person, weight of the person in kg and pounds, ID of the user and date.
